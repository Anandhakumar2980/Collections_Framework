# Collections Framework

## Introduction
   - The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
   - The Collection interface is the root interface of the collections framework hierarchy.
   - Java Collections can achieve all the operations perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
## Collections Framework Vs. Collection Interface
- The Collection interface is the root interface of the collections framework.
- The framework includes other interfaces like Map and Iterator.

## Collection Interface Types 
 **The collection interfaces are divided into two groups:**
- `java.util.Collection`  
- `java.util.Map`
